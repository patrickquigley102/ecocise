I've run out of time I'm able to spend on this exercise. It was enjoyable and
I have covered the basics however, there is room for improvement.

This should demonstrate my approach to such tasks adequately.

Next steps if I had more time.

- Determine way clear the Bikes application session data from with Capybara.
This would allow RSpec to use a random order of execution. Currently, this
project must execute the specs alphabetically which is brittle.
- DRY up the specs slightly, using RSpec's shared contexts.
- Decouple the specs from the DOM as much as possible.
- Create root page for Ecocise, with a button to trigger tests and means to
display the results in the browser.
- Use a Helm chart to create a Kubernetes deployment for these services.

Comments on my approach.

- I normally practice trunk-based development in git. That seemed redundant for
the purpose of the exercise as there was one contributor.


Thank you for your time, Patrick.

P.S. As a cyclist, I enjoyed the theme!
